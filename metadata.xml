    <description>	This mod allows you to practice any boss with any character and with any randomized amounts of items that you want.
	Character/Item/Boss configuration is done through the mod config menu, and the practice run can be started as a custom challenge where achievements are disabled.

	Mod Compatibility (WIP):
	- Modded characters will get added to the option list when a run is started with them, and they will be removed from the list if you ever &quot;reset to defaults&quot;
	- Modded characters will remain on the option list after you remove their mod, but the option will no longer work (even if you re-enable the mod), so you should &quot;reset to defaults&quot; to remove broken options.

Known Issues:
	- Modded Characters will overwrite Tainted Jacob/Esau's option.
	- Delirium won't be able to transform into another boss since you haven't encountered any other bosses during the run.</description>
