    <description>This mod allows you to practice any boss with any character and with any randomized amounts of items that you want.

Character/Item/Boss configuration is done through the mod config menu, and the practice run can be started as a custom challenge where achievements are disabled.

Mod Compatibility (WIP):
- Modded Characters will get imported to the mod menu's option list when you start a run with them.
- You can choose whether or not to use the tainted version of this character.
- If you uninstall the mod and try to start a practice run with the modded character, it will start a run with your chosen vanilla character

Known Issues:
- Delirium won't be able to transform into another boss since you haven't encountered any other bosses during the run.</description>
